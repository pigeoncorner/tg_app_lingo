        <div class="code-block">
The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health

Introduction

In recent years, social media platforms have become increasingly 
prevalent in daily life, particularly among adolescents and young 
adults. Research suggests that social media usage may have significant 
effects on mental health and well-being (Smith & Johnson, 2023). While 
some studies indicate positive outcomes related to social connectivity 
and peer support (Brown, 2022), others have identified concerning 
correlations between excessive social media use and increased anxiety 
and depression (Williams et al., 2024).

This essay examines the complex relationship between social media 
usage and mental health outcomes. It is argued that while social media 
platforms can provide valuable opportunities for connection and self-
expression, excessive or problematic use may contribute to negative 
psychological effects. The evidence suggests that multiple factors, 
including usage patterns, content type, and individual characteristics, 
mediate this relationship.

Research Findings

According to a longitudinal study conducted by Thompson and Davis 
(2023), adolescents who spent more than three hours per day on social 
media platforms demonstrated significantly higher levels of anxiety 
compared to those with moderate usage. However, it is important to 
note that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, and 
further research is needed to establish the directionality of this 
relationship.

Furthermore, several researchers have proposed that the type of social 
media engagement may be more important than the quantity of time spent 
online. Martinez et al. (2024) suggest that passive consumption of 
content, such as scrolling through feeds without interaction, may be 
more detrimental to mental health than active engagement, such as 
posting content and communicating with friends.

I recently stayed at your hotel from 15 to 18 January (Booking

While I appreciated the excellent location and friendly staff, there

        <h2>💡 Советы для реальной жизни</h2>

        <h3>1. Когда сомневаетесь — выбирайте более формальный стиль</h3>
        <p>Легче стать менее формальным позже, чем исправлять впечатление от излишней casual-ности.</p>

        <h3>2. Наблюдайте и учитесь</h3>
        <p>Обращайте внимание на то, как носители языка общаются в разных ситуациях.</p>

        <h3>3. Адаптируйтесь к собеседнику</h3>
        <p>Следуйте за стилем другого человека — это показывает уважение и социальную осведомлённость.</p>

        <h3>4. Помните о контексте</h3>
        <p>Письменная речь обычно более формальна, чем устная, даже в той же ситуации.</p>

        <h3>5. Будьте последовательны</h3>
        <p>Выбрав регистр в начале письма или разговора, придерживайтесь его до конца.</p>
